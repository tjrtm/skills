# Scan Checklist — 258 Detection Rules

The operational playbook. For each rule below, the detection method tells you what to search for and what to flag. Work through the categories that apply to the user's stack. Mark every applicable rule as PASS, FINDING, or N/A.

For severity ratings, see `vulnerabilities.md`.

## Scanning conventions

- Exclude `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `.git`, `vendor`, `.next`, `coverage` from all scans.
- `req.body`, `req.params`, `req.query` are the canonical Express patterns. Translate to the user's stack: in Next.js App Router it is `await req.json()` and `params`; in Laravel it is `$request->input()`; in FastAPI it is the request body parameter. Apply the spirit of the rule, not the literal pattern.
- For "missing X" rules (no rate limiter, no CSRF, no helmet), absence of the import in the entry point is strong evidence but not proof — note that runtime confirmation may be needed.
- Group related searches into one `rg` invocation when possible.

**13.7** Search for recursive functions. Flag if no depth limit or base-case guard exists on user-influenced input.

**13.8** Search for `addEventListener` or `on(` event registrations. Flag if no corresponding `removeEventListener` or `off(` exists in cleanup/unmount logic.

**13.9** Search for `fs.readFileSync`, `fs.writeFileSync`, `fs.readdirSync` in Express route handlers or equivalent. Flag synchronous I/O in async request handlers.

**13.10** Search for calls to external services (HTTP, DB, queue). Flag if no circuit breaker (or timeout + fallback) pattern is implemented.

## Category 14 — Cryptography

**14.1** Search for `createHash('md5')`, `createHash('sha1')`, `md5(`, `sha1(` applied to passwords. Flag every instance.

**14.2** Same but applied to token or session ID generation.

**14.3** Search for custom cipher, XOR, ROT13, or homegrown encryption implementations. Flag any found.

**14.4** Search for `Math.random()` used to generate tokens, IDs, nonces, or salts. Flag every instance.

**14.5** Search for AES encryption config. Flag if `ECB` mode is specified.

**14.6** Search for AES encryption calls. Flag if IV is a hardcoded string rather than `crypto.randomBytes(16)`.

**14.7** Search for RSA key generation or usage. Flag if key size is specified below 2048 bits.

**14.8** Check TLS certificate config or server setup. Flag if no cert renewal automation (Let's Encrypt, cert-manager) is configured.

**14.9** Search for encryption key derivation. Flag if a raw password string is used as an AES key without PBKDF2, scrypt, or argon2.

**14.10** Search for token generation and usage. Flag if tokens are used without any signature verification (HMAC, JWT verify, etc.).

## Category 15 — Supply Chain & Dependency Security

**15.1** Check repo root for `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `go.sum`, `Pipfile.lock`. Flag if absent.

**15.2** Search `package.json` for package names that are common typosquat targets. Flag unusual spellings of popular packages.

**15.3** Search `node_modules` (if accessible) or `package.json` for packages with `postinstall` scripts. Flag any that execute shell commands.

**15.4** Check `package.json` dependency versions. Flag if `^` or `~` ranges are used for security-critical packages (auth libraries, crypto, etc.).

**15.5** Search for `.github/dependabot.yml` or `renovate.json`. Flag if absent.

**15.6** Search for CI config (`.github/workflows`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`). Flag if secrets are echoed in run steps.

**15.7** Same — flag if workflows run with `permissions: write-all` or equivalent broad permissions.

**15.8** Note absence of package signing as low severity.

**15.9** Search for vendored third-party code in `vendor/`, `lib/`, or `utils/` directories. Flag if no license file or attribution comment exists.

## Category 16 — Business Logic

**16.1** Search for checkout or order creation endpoints. Flag if `price`, `amount`, or `total` is accepted from `req.body` rather than looked up server-side.

**16.2** Search for coupon or discount application logic. Flag if usage count per user is not tracked and enforced.

**16.3** Search for free trial logic. Flag if trial eligibility is checked only against email without also checking normalized form (+ aliases, dots in Gmail).

**16.4** Search for balance deduction or credit spending logic. Flag if not wrapped in a database transaction with a row lock (`SELECT FOR UPDATE`).

**16.5** Search for quantity fields in purchase flows. Flag if negative values are not rejected.

**16.6** Search for critical write operations (payment, order creation, user registration). Flag if no idempotency key is required or generated.

**16.7** Search for multi-step workflows (order state machine, KYC flow, onboarding steps). Flag if individual steps are accessible via direct API call without enforcing prior step completion.

**16.8** Search for data export or download endpoints. Flag if the query is not scoped to the authenticated user's own data.

**16.9** Search for account deletion handlers. Flag if related data in other tables is not deleted or anonymized.

**16.10** Search for referral or affiliate tracking. Flag if a user can apply their own referral code to their own account.

## Category 17 — Emerging Patterns (provisional)

> These checks cover patterns observed in the wild but not yet confirmed broadly enough to assign a stable severity. Report findings as provisional and note that they require manual verification.

**17.1** Search for computer use agent configuration or screenshot capture code. Flag if the agent takes screenshots of the user's screen and sends them to an LLM API without first redacting regions containing password fields, credit card inputs, or PII visible in other application windows.

**17.2** Search for AI-assisted code review integrations (GitHub Actions calling an LLM to review PRs). Flag if PR comment content is passed directly into the review prompt without sanitization, which would allow an attacker to inject instructions into the reviewer's output via a crafted PR comment.

**17.3** Search for agent or chatbot session initialization code. Flag if conversation state, memory, or tool context from a previous user's session is carried over into a new user's session rather than being reset on authentication.

**17.4** Search for image upload handlers that feed uploaded files to a multimodal LLM. Flag if EXIF metadata or embedded text is passed to the model without stripping, as these channels can carry injected instructions invisible to users.

## After All Checks Complete

1. Produce the full findings report in the format defined in `SKILL.md`.
2. Produce a **Priority Fix List** — the top 10 findings by severity and exploitability, ordered by "fix this first".
3. For each item in the Priority Fix List, provide the exact code change required — not a description of the fix, the actual code.
4. Produce the **Full Rule Results Table** — every rule ID with PASS / FINDING / N/A.
